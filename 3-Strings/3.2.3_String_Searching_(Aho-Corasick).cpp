/*

Given a set of strings (needles) and subsequent queries of texts (haystacks)
to be searched, determine all positions in which needles occur within the given
haystacks in linear time using the Aho-Corasick algorithm.

Note that this implementation uses an ordered map for storage of the graph,
adding an additional log k factor to the time complexities of all operations,
where k is the size of the alphabet (number of distinct characters used across
the needles). It also uses an ordered set for storage of the precomputed output
tables, adding an additional log m factor to the time complexities, where m is
the number of needles. In C++11 and later, both of these containers should be
replaced by their unordered versions for constant time access, thus eliminating
the log factors from the time complexities.

- aho_corasick(needles) constructs the finite-state automaton for a set of
  needle strings that are to be searched for subsequently in haystack queries.
- find_all_in(haystack, report_match) calls the function report_match(s, pos)
  once on each occurrence of each needle that occurs in the haystack, where pos
  is the starting position in the haystack at which string s (a matched needle)
  occurs. The matches will be reported in increasing order of their ending
  positions within the haystack.

Time Complexity:
- O(m*((log m) + l*log k)) per call to the constructor, where m is the number of
  needles, l is the maximum length for any needle, and k is the size of the
  alphabet used by the needles. If unordered containers are used, then the time
  complexity reduces to O(m*l), or linear on the input size.
- O(n*(log k) + z) per call to find_all_in(haystack, report_match), where n is
  the length of haystack, k is the size of the alphabet used by the needles, and
  z is the number of matches. If unordered containers are used, then the time
  complexity reduces to O(n + z), or linear on the input size.

Space Complexity:
- O(m*l) for storage of the automaton, where where m is the number of needles
  and l is the maximum length for any needle.
- O(1) auxiliary space per call to find_all_in(haystack, report_match).
